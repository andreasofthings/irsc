6.2.2	Industrial Visits:
----

Arrange and conduct series of presentations to local industry to promote IEEE membership, exchange ideas on how to improve IEEE local activities and services, and complete the IEEE surveys.  Refer to Saudi Arabia IRO presentation about “Values of IEEE Membership” under presentations section of the following website: www.ieee.org/saudia 
The following hints can assist you in accomplishing this task smoothly:

1. Use IEEE industry members to establish contact for industry visits

2. Try to contact the training coordinator of the company since IEEE activities add value to the development (administratively, management and technically) of company employees skills.  The training coordinator can assist in selling IEEE membership to the company management for their support.

3. Distribute a single page of question lists (members and non-members) during your presentations to industry.  This question list can also be used as a guideline by IRO when establishing personal contacts (face to face or telephone) with industry. Refer to Appendix B for more info.  

4. Follow-up with company representative to collect this questionnaire list and provide him with a reply to all of their questions and related issues.

5. Send an appreciation and thanking letter signed by IEEE Section chairto the top management of all companies visited by IRO. Refer to appendix C for a letter sample.

6. Send a VIP invitation to Companies’ top management to attend the opening ceremony of IEEE local and regional conferences organized by your local Section after consulting with conference organizing chair.Refer to Appendix E for a sample of this letter.

7. Send appreciation letter to companies’ top management thanking them for their sponsorship and contribution to our local and/or regional conferences after consulting with the conference organizing chair. Also, obtain his feedback about the event theme, papers arrangements after the conference. Refer to appendix D for a sample of this letter and Appendix F for Feedback form.

8. Send IEEE Section news letters to top companies’ management.

9. Send greeting cards to key management of industrial companies & universities during local festivals and special events.

10. Analyze the industry feedback from the survey and update your plans accordingly.

6.2.3 IEEE Booth:
-----


It is necessary to define and collect material to be able to set-up an IEEE booth or promotional desk at anytime and at any location. The booth must maintain technical material as samples of IEEE products and services, info about IEEE societies and technical sources that members can take advantage of, promotional gifts, on-line or on-spot IEEE membership registration, …etc.  
IRO needs to have a list of all IEEE local and regional conferences / events that he plans to establish an IEEE booth or promotional desk for the next 6-to-12 months.
Following are suggestions of material needed for IEEE Booth:

1. 1 to 2 Laptops or personal computers equipped with wireless LAN capability.  This is to enable on-line IEEE membership registration if internet access is available.

2. 1 Printer:  This is to print receipts when registering on-lines or purchasing IEEE Items.

3. IEEE Brochures such as “A Guide to Customizing Your IEEE Membership”, “Benefits of being IEEE Member”, “Membership Registration Form”, “Available Technical Virtual Forums”,…etc.

4. Samples of IEEE News Letters, Magazines and Proceedings

5. Flyers highlighting upcoming local and regional IEEE meetings & conferences.

6. Proceedings of recent Local and regional IEEE conferences & Technical Exchange Meetings.  These can be offered on CDs with minimum charge (less than $15)

7. One page survey/questionnaire sheets to obtain visitors feedback and their expectations from the local IEEE Section activities and services. Refer to Appendix B.

8. Banners and Posters: This could be about 6 to 8 role-up self-stand posters easy to pack and store to be distributed inside around the booth. Refer to Appendix H for sample of IEEE Banners.

9. Promotional gifts: Some of these gifts could be sponsored by local vendors and industry with logos from vendor and IEEE.  Such gifts could be; caps, pens, T-shirts, mugs, cups, calculators, key chains, alarm clocks, notebook folders, calendars …etc.  Refer to Appendix G for a sample of invitation memo to sponsor IEEE promotional gifts, Appendix A for list of suggested Booth material and Appendix I for IEEE promotional items/Print ready advertisement.

10. IEEE business cards to exchange with visitors for further help in the future.  

11. Table form for visitors interested to join IEEE to write their name and contacts to provide via e-mail the necessary info and guidance on how to join IEEE and expected benefits to individual and industry.

6.2.4 Dinner Meetings
------


1. Assist Section Chapters to invite speakers from local industry to speak about topics of interest to local professional communities. 

2. Identify vendors and local industry to sponsor such dinner meetings. Make some of these dinner meetings with free entrance (no charges) or minimal charges for all participants to attract as many industry professionals as possible.

3. Prepare a common table form for those non-members to write their name and contacts if they are interested to become IEEE members.  

4. Follow-up with these non-members via e-mail and post office mail highlighting to them how to register and benefits gained of being an IEEE member.

5. Distribute IEEE gifts to early birds participants and display an IEEE promotional desk that contain all relevant material about IEEE and future events

6. Obtain valuable gifts from local vendors and companies to be drawn at the end of the dinner speech between all participants

7. Invite students to speak during the first 10 minutes of the dinner meeting (before the primary speech) about their project. This is to increase awareness and bridge the gap between industry and academia

8. Display IEEE poster around the conference room area.

9. Send an appreciation letter from Section Chair to those speakers and companies for their contribution

10. Take photo pictures and assist Chapter Chairs to write articles in local newspapers about the event and update the section website
